# Draggable Diagrams workshop

Hey thanks for joining the workshop and trying out Draggable Diagrams / D2 / TROGDOR / TBD. My hope is that this will be a fun and interesting and creative experience. I'm also hoping to learn some things from you, like

- What kind of diagrams are you dreaming of making? (And how could this system grow to help you with them?)
- What kind of new diagrammy ideas arise from working with this system?
- What is it like to work with this system, and how could I make it better?

Let's jump in!

## What is Draggable Diagrams?

Draggable Diagrams is a framework for making interactive diagrams. "Diagrams" here is potentially broad – it could include diagrams of mathematical structures, weird new controllers, direct-manipulation editors, and other interfaces besides. The unique angle of Draggable Diagrams is, as the name implies, making drag-drop interactions easier to implement. It does this with a React-y, state-centric approach. In Draggable Diagrams, you write a "render" function that turns underlying state into an SVG drawing. To make an object in this drawing draggable, you need only describe what *new states* should be accessible by dragging it. Draggable Diagrams will pre-render these possible drawings, and use them to guide a drag-drop interaction.
